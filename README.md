# Dashed Web Components

The project is at a very early stage! This work has just begun and is still in progress ...
It contains a set of dashed web components. You can control the dash - width/length/spacing, which is not possible with the CSS dashed border. I use the CSS border-image to show the SVG dash. CSSPaintWorklet might be an alternative to the SVG border-image.
