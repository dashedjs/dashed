# Dashed Web Components

The project is at a very early stage! This work has just begun and is still in progress ...
It contains a set of dashed web components. You can control the dash - width/length/spacing/color, which is not possible with regular CSS dashed border. I use the CSS border-image to show the SVG dash. CSSPaintWorklet might be an alternative to the SVG url(), especially since CSS custom properties are not supported inside (background/border)-image 's url.
